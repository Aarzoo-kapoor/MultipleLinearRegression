# MultipleLinearRegression
After acquiring knowledge about simple linear regression, it's time to move ahead to multiple linear regression.Here, I have taken dataset from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/srolka/ecommerce-customers) showcasing Customer Spending Prediction Dataset

Overview

This dataset aims to predict the Yearly Amount Spent by customers based on several customer-related features. It serves as a practical example for implementing regression techniques to model relationships between customer characteristics and their spending behavior. By analyzing this dataset, you can build models to forecast customer spending and understand key factors that influence it.

Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following columns:

Email: The customer's email address (unique identifier).

Address: The residential address of the customer.

Avatar: The profile avatar or character associated with the customer.

Time on App: The total time spent on the mobile app (in minutes).

Time on Website: The total time spent on the website (in minutes).

Length of Membership: The duration (in years) of the customer's membership.

Yearly Amount Spent: The total amount spent by the customer per year (in USD).

Data Format

The dataset is stored in a CSV file.

Applications

Regression Analysis: Predict the yearly spending based on customer engagement metrics.
